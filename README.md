# Artificial Life Simulator
This application simulates a complex, evolving ecosystem that demonstrates a variety of real-world evolutionary systems such as: allopatric speciation, k-selection, parallel evolution and more.

I wrote this project for my OCR A-Level Computer Science NEA.


# What I Learned
• Managing the scope of a project and meeting a deadline.

• Many complex algorithms including neural networks.

• How to use WGPU to write a custom render pipeline.

• Designing simple GUI using EGUI that includes graphs generated from simulation data.

This was a big learning curve and the biggest takeaway was to really plan a large project, its structure and its milestones before making it.
